# Week 2 - Session 1 - Tech writer assistant

This is the homework for Week 2, Session 1. The goal is to play around with Langsmith, a tool that allows you to gain insights into interactions between your code, LLMs, vector databases, and more.

## Overview

In this session, we introduced a tech writer assistant that leverages AI to assist in updating README files based on code changes in pull requests. The assistant processes commit messages, file diffs, and existing README content to generate relevant updates.

## Features

- **Code Change Analysis**: The assistant analyzes code changes and extracts relevant information from pull requests.
- **Commit Message Processing**: It consolidates commit messages related to the pull request for context.
- **README Updates**: Automatically updates the README files based on the analysis of code changes and commit messages.

## Components

1. **AI Utilization**: The assistant employs the Langchain library for AI-driven insights, using models such as `gpt-4o-mini` for generating content.
2. **GitHub Integration**: The system integrates with GitHub to retrieve pull request information, including diffs and commit messages.
3. **Linear API**: It fetches related issues from the Linear API to provide additional context for the changes.

## Usage

Ensure to set the necessary environment variables for GitHub and Linear API access. The assistant can be triggered by running the `run` function, which processes the pull request and generates updates to the README files.

## Next Steps

Continue exploring the capabilities of the tech writer assistant and consider integrating more advanced features, such as additional analysis of code changes or support for multiple README formats.
