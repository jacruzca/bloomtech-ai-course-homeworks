# Week 3 - Tools

Design and implement functions that can be supplied to a LLM to perform complex mathematical operations and calculations.

## Overview

In this week’s assignment, we focus on implementing tools that can be called by a language model to perform specific tasks. Below are the tools that have been implemented:

### Tools

- **Quadratic Equation Solver**: This tool solves quadratic equations given coefficients \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \). It handles both real and complex roots, returning them in a user-friendly format.
  
- **Fibonacci Sequence Generator**: This function generates the Fibonacci sequence up to a specified number \( n \). It can be implemented using either iterative or recursive methods and is optimized for large values of \( n \).

- **Currency Converter**: This tool converts an amount from one currency to another using real-time exchange rates. It requires an external API to fetch the latest rates.

- **Random Number Generator**: Generates a random number between two input numbers, providing flexibility in applications requiring randomization.

## Usage

To use the tools, you can invoke them through the agent, which processes requests and returns results based on the provided input. Make sure to initialize the environment correctly and have all necessary dependencies installed.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the necessary dependencies.
3. Set up your environment variables as needed.
4. Run the application to interact with the functions.

This week’s focus aims to enhance your understanding of integrating tools into language models, allowing for a more interactive and functional approach to problem-solving.
