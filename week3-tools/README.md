# Week 3 - Tools

Design and implement functions that can be supplied to a LLM to perform complex mathematical operations and calculations.

Here are some to consider:

- Quadratic Equation Solver: Create a function to solve quadratic equations given coefficients a, b, and c. The function should handle real and complex roots and return them in a user-friendly format

- Fibonacci Sequence Generator: Write a function to generate the Fibonacci sequence up to a given number n using either iterative or recursive methods. Optimize for large values of n.

- Currency Converter: Create a function that converts an amount from one currency to another using real-time exchange rates. This function may require calling an external API to fetch the latest rates.
