# Week 2 - Session 1 - Tech Writer Assistant

This is the homework for Week 2. The goal is to play around with Langsmith, a tool that allows you to gain insights into interactions between your code, LLMs, vector databases, and more.

The idea is just to interact with Langsmith and see how it works.
